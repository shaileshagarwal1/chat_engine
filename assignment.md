# Week 3 Assignment: Chat Engine Memory Implementation

If you were to implement an improvement to the chat history module of our previous session using ChromaDB, how do you suppose you  would upsert the message pairs (user query, assistant's response) into a chroma collection? And how would you retrieve these message pairs in their entirety?

Write a Python script that defines these 2 functions without worrying yet about integrating them to the `ChatMemoryBuffer` class or the rest of the chat engine. The retrieval function should return a list of all the message pairs in the chat history.
